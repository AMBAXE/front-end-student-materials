# Getting Set Up!

Let's get set up with the tools you'll need!

## Sign Up for Github
Head to [Github.com](https://www.github.com) and sign up for an account. Github, at it's simplest, is the "Google Docs of Code" - we'll learn more about it later on, but for now you'll just need an account.

## Cloud9

+ **Join the Upperline Organization on [Cloud9](https://c9.io)**
The main tool you'll be using is called Cloud9 - it's an IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) that is a computer in the cloud. It has a built-in text editor, command line, and file navigator. You'll be creating files in the command line, writing your code in the text editor, and looking at your file structure in the file navigator. You'll get an invite from Upperline to join the organization. Use your **Github account** to sign up for Cloud9 and join the Upperline Organization.

+ **Create a new HTML5 Workspace**
Once you've signed up, you'll need to create a workspace (this is where you'll be working!). Click "Create a New Workspace" and then select the "HTML5" workspace. Give it a name like "yourname-front-end".
