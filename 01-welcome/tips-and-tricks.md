# Tips and Tricks

+ **Pair Programming** - Work with a friend or partner. If one of you types while the other provides guidance and does research on their own computer, you'll move faster, learn more (because you need to explain concepts to each other), and catch errors much more quickly.

+ **Take a breath** - Learning to code is truly an exercise in developing patience with yourself. You are inevitably going to hit a wall, and your frustration levels will rise. **This is normal**. Hitting that wall means you're pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. When this happens, step away from your computer. Take some breaths. Squeeze a stress ball. Go for a walk. Take a nap. Then come back to it!

+ **Google (or Bing) It** - When you're getting errors or just can't figure out how to do something, Google is your friend. Part of being a great developer is learning to ask the right questions and read through resources online. Always start your troubleshooting by asking Google. Someone has probably asked the same question before you.

+ **Build, Build, Build** - Ask any professional developer and you'll hear the same thing: "I learned to code by picking projects and building them." You can go through every lab and every online tutorial and still not really know how to code. Putting your skills into practice is the only real way to solidify your knowledge and become a true developer.
