# Welcome to Front End Development

Hello! Welcome to Upperline's Front End Development Course! We're super excited that you're here and know that you'll love learning how to build beautiful and dynamic web pages using top developer tools. Before we dive into the work, let's talk a little bit about what this 'Front End' thing is anyway, and how things work from here!

## What is Front End Development?
Front End Development covers everything that a *user* sees and interacts with when they go to a website or web app. It's the visual part of web and app development.

I like to think of it as you would building the car: The front-end people are building the car's 'look' - the paint job, the leather on the seats, the dials on the dashboard, etc.

The back-end developers, on the other hand, deal with the logic that happens behind the scenes. They are the people who deal with the car's engine.  users know it's important, but unless they're mechanics they never really touch the engine.

## What will we be covering?
In this course, we'll be covering the fundamentals of front end web development. By the end of this course you'll have the skills and experience to build websites that are graphically appealing and also integrate some neat user interaction. Here's a brief breakdown of the units.

+ **Setup:** We'll get all the right tools set up that we need to start building
+ **Command Line:** Learn to use the most powerful tool on your computer and start working with you terminal like a real developer.
+ **HTML:** The skeleton of every website on the internet.
+ **CSS:** Make your websites look professional by applying custom formatting and layouts.
+ **JavaScript with P5js:** Create amazing interactive art on your pages.
+ **Javascript and JQuery:** Make your websites dynamic by listening for user events.


## How does this curriculum work?
Great question. This course is broken down into a few different types of assignment:
+ **Readings:** Pages like this one, that offer new information and walkthroughs. Make sure to read carefully!
+ **Videos:** We've put together some videos to supplement the information you're getting from the readings. They are either embedded gifs (for shorter pieces), or YouTube Videos linked from our page.
+ **Labs:** Labs are short assignments (between 10 minutes and an hour) that help you solidify the knowledge that you're getting from the reading and videos.
+ **Projects:** These are longer term projects that let you use the skills you've learned in a meaningful way to you. Projects are open ended - there's always more that you can do and add to - the sky is really the limit.
+ **Extra Resources:** We try to provide links to other sites if you want to learn more about a specific topic. If you have some free time, dive in to these!
