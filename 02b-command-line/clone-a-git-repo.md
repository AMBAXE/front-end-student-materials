# Cloning a Repository from Github
Github is the "Google Docs of Code" - it allows developers to store their code in the cloud and share it with people around the world. In this lesson, we're going to learn how to download a repository (or "Repo") from Github using `git` in the command line. Git is a version control system that allows us to save our work at different times.

## What are Repositories?
A Repository is just a directory with a collection of files and folders that are "tracked" by github. You can think of a repository as a code project.

## From the Cloud to your Computer (Cloning)
1. Navigate to the github repo you want to clone. [Here is an example for you to use FILL URL](Sample)
2. Click the "Fork Button" on the top right and choose your profile to make a copy to. A fork is an identical copy of a repository, but that belongs to you.
3. Click the green "Clone or Download" link on the right side and copy the address.
4. In your terminal, navigate to your development directory (so you have all of your work in the same place)
