# Attributes for Links and Images

In this section, we're going to learn how to use attributes inside of our HTML elements. Attributes provide extra information to the element, like where a photo is, or where a link should direct users to.

##  Linking
To create a link to another website or page in your project, use the anchor `<a>` tag. Surround whatever content you want to link with an opening and closing `<a>` tag. The `<a>` tag takes the attribute `href`, which points to the address that the link will send users to. For example:

```html
<a href="www.google.com">
  <h2> Click here for my favorite search engine </h2>
</a>
```
